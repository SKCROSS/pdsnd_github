### Explore bike share data across three cities: Washington, NY, Chicago
I created this bikeshare data project 07/01 and this README file 08/04.

### Project description
My project explores bike share data across three cities to answer three questions:
 - how does user type vary across cities and does user behaviour change between subscribers and customers
 - how extreme values impact on frequency plots and numerical summaries for trip duration
 - how travel times differ over seasons and between weekends/weekdays
